                <p>This page was created to provide a platform for everyone from previous batches to share their
                    experiences with the choir. There isn't much yet, but maybe some of the stories here will be interesting to you reading. Click on a photo to see a story!</br></br>

                    Stories are sorted in chronological order by when they were taken so as you scroll down you'll dive deeper into the history of VJChoir and maybe see seniors that you don't even know exist any more :)</br></br>
                    
                    Have something to
                    share that makes you passionate, angry, betrayed, sad, happy or any other of the various emotions
                    that people feel? Feel free to submit your own story below! </br></br>
                
                    <b>Q: How do I submit a story? And what qualifies as one?</b></br>
                    A: Anything goes! I recommend stuff that isn't so personal, but you can leave your name as anonymous and send it in anyway. I'll be the one looking through the stories (if any are submitted) before posting it here.
                    </br></br>
                    <b>Q: Is there a word limit? Or any requirements?</b></br>
                    A: Nope! You can even send in a photo that you like and just tell me you don't want anything on it. :)</p>
