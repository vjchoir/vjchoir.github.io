Content from the various years has been provided by passionate individuals and choristers who have contacted me and provided me with the information regarding their batches, music and other parts of the website. Without them, a lot of the content here would be too redundant and outdated to even call the website an archive.</br></br>To ensure that our legacy lives on, we need your help to contribute what information you can to the website. Photos, batch information, recordings etc. are things that you can send in so that we can bolster our archives with content.</br></br>I am also looking for interested developers who have ideas and are willing to work on them to improve the website. If you're interested in learning how to do this, you have to learn <b>HTML, CSS and Angular</b> in order to get your stuff functional. It's intimidating, but I'll be here to help if you run into hiccups along the way!</br></br>If you wish to contact me directly, you can do so by emailing <b>hoe.chan.wei.daniel.2014@vjc.sg</b>. I'll take awhile to respond but that's the most direct route to me! If not, you can fill up the form below and it'll send an email to the archives' email!</br></br>If you have any feedback as well, please don't hesitate to email or fill up the form below! Any comments you may have are important to ensuring that the archivals are the best quality they can be!</p>"
