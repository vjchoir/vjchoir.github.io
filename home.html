    <p>Welcome to the unofficial official webpage for the Victoria Junior College Choir. In this website, there is a repository
            of batch information, songs and other cool stuff that you can peruse. Enjoy!  </br></br>
        <b>Special announcement / appeal:</b> Hi, so you've come back to this home page and found that oh wow there's a lot of content here so I'm gonna go and browse. BUT WAIT. I need your help. If you belong to the current batch of VJChoir (2019 - 2020) you'll have heard me and Pei Jing advertising for NUSChoir the other day probably, and I really do need your help in keeping the website updated. 
    </br></br> Another important thing is about SOV. The problem with SOV now is that all the previous recordings exist somewhere but I need to get to the teachers in charge to access the info. If any of y'all are able to liaise with any of them, drop me an email at <b>hoe.chan.wei.daniel.2014@vjc.sg</b> or <b>danielhoe97@gmail.com</b> to get in touch. Thanks a lot :)</p>
