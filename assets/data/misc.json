          "answer": "The website started off as a simple Google Sites kinda thing where you could drag and drop content boxes and stuff to indicate where things were. After I picked up programming I started improving on the site, and after a lot of work here we are! :)"

          "answer": "Well, since this site just needs to serve up the information and there aren't many things we need to keep private or authenticate, the data is stored in the GitHub repository itself (since it's free and I'm cheap)! It works fine so far, and there aren't any plans to shift the current system :)"

The problem with that is that we need to get licensing rights for some songs, and also there is a lot of cost involved that I'm trying to avoid to get the music on there. I'd like a playlist of VJChoir music on these platforms too but there's no easy way to get stuff on there :("

          "answer": "Well I honestly don't know, it really depends on my interest or the interest of any other individuals from the choir! If you want to pick up some of the work around here, do drop me a message :)"
