This is also the page where I'm looking for people to contribute to the website in many ways, and I'll let you know what help I need! To get in touch with me, Daniel, you can either email <b>hoe.chan.wei.daniel.2014@vjc.sg</b> or fill up the form below!</br></br><b>Batch Information</b></br>This is straightforward enough, I try to keep an updated page on the current batch and students who comprise that batch, and the only way to obtain such information is to contact people directly from that batch! If your batch's information isn't available here, feel free to drop me a message to contribute that information!</br></br><b>Writers (for write-ups)</b></br>One of the ideas I had (but don't have any time to collect info. for) is to obtain writeups for all the songs we have on the website. Like from the booklets and everything, and I need help to do this! If you're interested, drop me a message!</br></br><b>Developers</b></br>This one is a bit of a long shot, but if you have ideas that you know how to implement using HTML, CSS and Angular, please don't hestitate to drop me a message! You can gain access to the repository and make your own changes to the website! :)"
