			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions!</h2>
			<p><b>Q: How did you make the website?</b></p>
			<p>A: It's a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML tells your browser what you wanna show, CSS does
				the
				design and Javascript does the coding magic for the music player and stuff.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Can we get our music on Spotify / Apple Music?</b></p>
			<p>A: Technically yes, but there is a lot of red tape in the way. You need to get the permission of every
				single
				composer and their record labels or whatever which costs money and I do not have money lmao.</p>
			<p><b>Q: Why are there no videos for some years?</b></p>
			<p>A: Those years the videos have been lost to other archives not as well maintained as this one probably. A
				lot
				of the older videos and recordings are probably with the infocomm society of VJ that I'm unable to
				contact.
				(if you do be able please do contact me I appreciate it a lot)</p>
			<p><b>Q: How long will you maintain this site?</b></p>
			<p>A: I have no idea. This is like some sort of passion project for me and it has been like that for awhile.
				So
				has jumpcutfindo. There's some sense of fulfilment I guess when I do this so I'll keep doing it until I
				don't feel like it.</p>
			<p><b>Q: What happened to the "Stories" portion of the website?</b></p>
			<p>A: As of now I've retired it because I have an idea for a text and photo kind of stories section, and
				that's
				gonna take some time to code. So for now I've removed the page, but the stuff you've contributed so far
				(or
				at least one person has lol) will be kept for now and reposted in the future :)</p>
