    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions!</h2>
    <p><b>Q: How did you make the website?</b></p>
	<p>A: It's a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML tells your browser what you wanna show, CSS does the design and Javascript does the coding magic for the music player and stuff.</p>
	<p><b>Q: Can we get our music on Spotify / Apple Music?</b></p>
	<p>A: Technically yes, but there is a lot of red tape in the way. You need to get the permission of every single composer and their record labels or whatever which costs money and I do not have money lmao.</p>
	<p><b>Q: Why are there no videos for some years?</b></p>
	<p>A: Those years the videos have been lost to other archives not as well maintained as this one probably. A lot of the older videos and recordings are probably with the infocomm society of VJ that I'm unable to contact. (if you do be able please do contact me I appreciate it a lot)</p>
	<p><b>Q: How long will you maintain this site?</b></p>
	<p>A: I have no idea. This is like some sort of passion project for me and it has been like that for awhile. So has jumpcutfindo. There's some sense of fulfilment I guess when I do this so I'll keep doing it until I don't feel like it.</p>
