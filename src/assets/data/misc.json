The problem with that is that we need to get licensing rights for some songs, and also there is a lot of cost involved that I'm trying to avoid to get the music on there. I'd like a playlist of VJChoir music on these platforms too but there's no easy way to get stuff on there :(</br></br><b>Q: How long will you maintain this website for?</b></br>I mean right now I have no plans to stop, but maintaining it does take up a lot of time and effort (but mainly around SOV season for updating information).</p>"
