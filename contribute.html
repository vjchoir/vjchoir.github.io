        <h2>Welcome to the Contribute page!</h2>
        <p>Hi there! On this page, you'll be able to find out how to contribute any information you think will help to
            develop this archive further.
            </br></br>
            <b>Contact information</b></br>
            You can contact me (Daniel) at the following email address: <b>hoe.chan.wei.daniel.2014@vjc.sg</b>, or
            Telegram <b>@themeef</b> if you have stuff you need to discuss / is urgent.
            </br></br>
            <b>Content contribution (Batches or Symphony of Voices related stuff)</b></br>
            If you've discovered any problems with the content that you've seen on this webpage, or you have something
            that you want to add on to the archive, please contact me at the places given above. One of the major
            hurdles of the website is keeping in touch with the junior batches, and information from those batches gets
            harder and harder to reach when the years pass. If you want to see this website live on and carry on
            VJChoir's legacy, please don't hesitate to contact me or to get someone else to contact me so that your
            batch's details can be remembered on this website.</br></br>
            <b>I'm interested in helping out with the nitty gritty of the website!</b></br>
            If you're really that hardcore and into the choir, you're very welcome to help with the running of the
            website. Every year, there's new information to be gathered and there's coding to be done, so if you have
            some experience / exams are over and are free and wanna try to learn some stuff you can contact me and we
            can work something out from there! :)
            </br></br>
            <b>I wanna give feedback on the website! (Design ideas, section ideas etc.)</b></br>
            If you have feedback you wanna give, email me too! I welcome any type of feedback, whether be it critical or
            ideas or anything.
        </p>
